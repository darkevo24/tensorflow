    "Abstract": "Acid-base disorders are common in the intensive care unit. By utilizing a systematic approach to their diagnosis, it is easy to identify both simple and mixed disturbances. These disorders are divided into four major categories: metabolic acidosis, metabolic alkalosis, respiratory acidosis, and respiratory alkalosis. Metabolic acidosis is subdivided into anion gap and non-gap acidosis. Distinguishing between these is helpful in establishing the cause of the acidosis. Anion gap acidosis, caused by the accumulation of organic anions from sepsis, diabetes, alcohol use, and numerous drugs and toxins, is usually present on admission to the intensive care unit. Lactic acidosis from decreased delivery or utilization of oxygen is associated with increased mortality. This is likely secondary to the disease process, as opposed to the degree of acidemia. Treatment of an anion gap acidosis is aimed at the underlying disease or removal of the toxin. The use of therapy to normalize the pH is controversial. Non-gap acidoses result from disorders of renal tubular H + transport, decreased renal ammonia secretion, gastrointestinal and kidney losses of bicarbonate, dilution of serum bicarbonate from excessive intravenous fluid administration, or addition of hydrochloric acid. Metabolic alkalosis is the most common acid-base disorder found in patients who are critically ill, and most often occurs after admission to the intensive care unit. Its etiology is most often secondary to the aggressive therapeutic interventions used to treat shock, acidemia, volume overload, severe coagulopathy, respiratory failure, and AKI. Treatment consists of volume resuscitation and repletion of potassium deficits. Aggressive lowering of the pH is usually not necessary. Respiratory disorders are caused by either decreased or increased minute ventilation. The use of permissive hypercapnia to prevent barotrauma has become the standard of care. The use of bicarbonate to correct the acidemia is not recommended. In patients at the extreme, the use of extracorporeal therapies to remove CO 2 can be considered."

    "Abstract": "<br><b>OBJECTIVES:</b> Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is reemerging as an exciting form of brain stimulation, due in part to the development of its noninvasive counterpart transcutaneous auricular VNS. As the field grows, it is important to understand where VNS emerged from, including its history and the studies that were conducted over the past four decades. Here, we offer a comprehensive review of the history of VNS in the treatment of major depression.<br><b>MATERIALS AND METHODS:</b> Using PubMed, we reviewed the history of VNS and aggregated the literature into a narrative review of four key VNS epochs: 1) early invention and development of VNS, 2) path to Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for depression, 3) refinement of VNS treatment parameters, and 4) neuroimaging of VNS.<br><b>RESULTS:</b> VNS was described in the literature in the early 1900s; however, gained traction in the 1980s as Zabara and colleagues developed an implantable neurocybernetic prosthesis to treat epilepsy. As epilepsy trials proceed in the 1990s, promising mood effects emerged and were studied, ultimately leading to the approval of VNS for depression in 2005. Since then, there have been advances in understanding the mechanism of action. Imaging techniques like functional magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography further aid in understanding direct brain effects of VNS.<br><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b> The mood effects of VNS were discovered from clinical trials investigating the use of VNS for reducing seizures in epileptic patients. Since then, VNS has gone on to be FDA approved for depression. The field of VNS is growing, and as noninvasive VNS quickly advances, it is important to consider a historical perspective to develop future brain stimulation therapies."

    "Abstract": "Loop diuretics are among the most widely used drugs worldwide and are commonly employed in the management of complications associated with acute kidney injury (AKI), namely volume overload and electrolyte management. The use of loop diuretics in critically ill patients with AKI is paramount to preventing or treating pulmonary edema. The naturetic response to a loop diuretic is based on its unique renal pharmacology. Our review article summarizes the pharmacology of furosemide in the intact nephron and discusses how this response might be altered by the presence of AKI. We discuss the increasing body of literature on the latest clinical utility of furosemide namely, it's challenge test, known as the furosemide stress test which has highlighted a new and novel role for furosemide over the past number of years. This test assists with the identification of AKI subjects at higher risk of AKI progression and the need for renal replacement therapy. The stress test can also predict cessation of continuous renal replacement therapy in patients with established AKI. On the basis of the evidence presented in this review, we propose future potential studies of furosemide in AKI."

    "Abstract": "Temporomandibular disorders affect between 5% and 12% of the population and present with symptoms such as headache, bruxism, pain at the temporomandibular joint, jaw popping or clicking, neck pain, tinnitus, dizziness, decreased hearing, and hyperacuity to sound. Common signs on physical examination include tenderness of the pterygoid muscles, temporomandibular joints, and temporalis muscles, and malocclusion of the jaw and crepitus. The diagnosis is based on history and physical examination; however, use of computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging is recommended if the diagnosis is in doubt. Nonpharmacologic therapy includes patient education (e.g., good sleep hygiene, soft food diet), cognitive behavior therapy, and physical therapy. Pharmacologic therapy includes nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, cyclobenzaprine, tricyclic antidepressants, and gabapentin. Injections of the temporomandibular joints with sodium hyaluronate, platelet-rich plasma, and dextrose prolotherapy may be considered, but the evidence of benefit is weak. A referral to oral and maxillofacial surgery is indicated for refractory cases."

    "Abstract": "Diabetes-related foot infections occur in approximately 40% of diabetes-related foot ulcers and cause significant morbidity. Clinicians should consider patient risk factors (e.g., presence of foot ulcers greater than 2 cm, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, poor vascular perfusion, comorbid illness) when evaluating for a foot infection or osteomyelitis. Indicators of infection include erythema, induration, tenderness, warmth, and drainage. Superficial wound cultures should be avoided because of the high rate of contaminants. Deep cultures obtained through aseptic procedures (e.g., incision and drainage, debridement, bone culture) help guide treatment. Plain radiography is used for initial imaging if osteomyelitis is suspected; however, magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography may help if radiography is inconclusive, the extent of infection is unknown, or if the infection orientation needs to be determined to help in surgical planning. Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae are the most commonly isolated pathogens, although polymicrobial infections are common. Antibiotic therapy should cover commonly isolated organisms and reflect local resistance patterns, patient preference, and the severity of the foot infection. Mild and some moderate infections may be treated with oral antibiotics. Severe infections require intravenous antibiotics. Treatment duration is typically one to two weeks and is longer for slowly resolving infections or osteomyelitis. Severe or persistent infections may require surgery and specialized team-based wound care. Although widely recommended, there is little evidence on the effectiveness of primary prevention strategies. Systematic assessment, counseling, and comorbidity management are hallmarks of effective secondary prevention for diabetes-related foot infections."

He developed an anastomotic leak after a redo ileocolic resection and now has a chronic low-output enterocutaneous fistula. He was transferred from an outside institution for further management and is currently without Crohn's disease (CD)-related medical therapy. The fistula output is 25 to 50 mL/day of GI contents. His weight dropped by 25 pounds in 6 months after surgery with a current BMI of 19.1, albumin of 2.0 g/dL, and hemoglobin of 9.7 g/dL. During a 3-month period, he was optimized for surgery with local wound care, initiation of infliximab, and nutritional support with exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN). He gained 9 pounds (BMI 20.4). Albumin improved to 3.4 g/dL and hemoglobin to 12.1 g/dL. He underwent a successful open takedown of the enterocutaneous fistula with ileocolic anastomosis."

    "Abstract": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease is characterized by the development of progressive bronchiectasis and impaired lung function with severe airflow obstruction. CF patients suffer from shortened life expectancy, primarily driven by respiratory failure. The mechanism by which CF lung disease develops is the result of an interplay of multiple intrinsic and extrinsic factors including genotype, abnormalities in mucus composition and movement, chronic inflammation, and chronic airway infection. Although all CF patients are at increased risk for pulmonary complications including hemoptysis, pneumothorax, pulmonary hypertension, and chronic hypoxic and hypercapnic respiratory failure, the risk of developing these complications increases with progression of lung disease. The focus of this article is to summarize the pathophysiology, epidemiology, and management of these key pulmonary complications."

The current standard, static cold storage, is a simple and cost-effective method of preserving grafts, but offers little flexibility with limited ability to mitigate ischemic-reperfusion injury, inflammation, and hypothermic tissue damage. Novel ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) devices, TransMedics OCS and XVIVO perfusion systems, extend preservation time by perfusing, and ventilating donor lungs while simultaneously allowing for evaluation of lung viability. Perfusate, preservation solutions, additives, temperature regulation, and assessment of organ damage are all critical components when evaluating the success and outcomes of these devices.<br><b>EXPERT OPINION:</b> EVLP devices are more costly and often require additional resources and personnel support compared to static cold storage, but may provide the opportunity to extend preservation time, perform functional assessment, mitigate ischemic injury, and optimize extended criteria donors."

    "Abstract": "Aldehydes are widespread in the environment, with multiple sources such as food and beverages, industrial effluents, cigarette smoke, and additives. The toxic effects of exposure to several aldehydes have been observed in numerous studies. At the molecular level, aldehydes damage DNA, cross-link DNA and proteins, lead to lipid peroxidation, and are associated with increased disease risk including cancer. People genetically predisposed to aldehyde sensitivity exhibit severe health outcomes. In various diseases such as Fanconi's anemia and Cockayne syndrome, loss of aldehyde-metabolizing pathways in conjunction with defects in DNA repair leads to widespread DNA damage. Importantly, aldehyde-associated mutagenicity is being explored in a growing number of studies, which could offer key insights into how they potentially contribute to tumorigenesis. Here, we review the genotoxic effects of various aldehydes, focusing particularly on the DNA adducts underlying the mutagenicity of environmentally derived aldehydes. We summarize the chemical structures of the aldehydes and their predominant DNA adducts, discuss various methodologies, in vitro and in vivo, commonly used in measuring aldehyde-associated mutagenesis, and highlight some recent studies looking at aldehyde-associated mutation signatures and spectra. We conclude the Review with a discussion on the challenges and future perspectives of investigating aldehyde-associated mutagenesis."

    "Abstract": "Ion channels play a crucial role in cellular signaling, homeostasis, and generation of electrical and chemical signals. Aberrant expression and dysregulation of ion channels have been associated with cancer development and resistance to conventional cancer treatment such as chemotherapy. Several molecular mechanisms have been proposed to explain this phenomenon. Including evasion of apoptosis, decreased drug accumulation in cancer cells, detoxifying and activation of alternative escape pathways such as autophagy. Each of these mechanisms leads to a reduction of the therapeutic efficacy of administered drugs, causing more difficulty in cancer treatment. This review highlights the linkages between ion channels and resistance to chemotherapy. Furthermore, it elaborates their molecular mechanisms and the potential of being therapeutic targets in clinical management."

Nonetheless, the accuracy and diagnostic value of these methods may not always be conclusive and the assessment of liver histology often remains the gold standard for diagnostic evaluation. The purpose of this review is to summarize the current role of liver biopsy in contemporary hepatology practice.<br><b>RECENT FINDINGS:</b> Technical factors were found to influence the diagnostic value of liver biopsy and histological examination of the liver, including specimen number and size (preferably ≥3 nonfragmented specimens of >20 mm in length), needle diameter (1.6 mm Menghini), number of passes (mean 2.5), imaging-guidance, and operator experience. Liver biopsy was demonstrated to be diagnostically valuable in the evaluation of persistently abnormal liver tests of unclear cause, with histology pointing to a specific diagnosis in 84% of patients. Although coagulation abnormalities continue to be an important concern when performing liver biopsy, their influence on complication risk remains unclear. Implementation of less stringent preprocedural coagulation thresholds decreased preprocedural transfusions without increasing the bleeding rate. Serious complications associated with percutaneous liver-biopsy (PLB) and transjugular liver-biopsy are similar, but pain appears to be more common with PLB.<br><b>SUMMARY:</b> Histopathological evaluation continues to be fundamentally important in assessing hepatic disease, and liver histology remains the most accurate approach to assess fibrosis and assign prognosis."

    "Abstract": "Transient global amnesia (TGA) is a clinical syndrome characterized by anterograde amnesia, mild retrograde amnesia, and confusion up to 24 hours. Most commonly seen in patients older than 50 years, TGA results from the temporary impairment of short-term memory formation. Clinically, patients have time disorientation and often ask repeated questions regarding the day's events. Vomiting, headache, blurry vision, dizziness, and nausea may be present. A physically or psychologically stressful precipitating event, such as emotional stress, significant physical exertion, exposure to extreme temperatures, high-altitude conditions, Valsalva maneuver, acute illness, or sexual intercourse, is often the cause. The pathophysiology of TGA is not well understood but may be related to impaired venous drainage of the hippocampus. The diagnosis is primarily clinical, but recent studies suggest that magnetic resonance imaging may be helpful. TGA is self-limited and resolves within 24 hours. There is no established treatment for episodes. The lifetime recurrence rate is 2.9% to 23.8%. Recent evidence suggests an association between TGA and migraine headaches as well as takotsubo cardiomyopathy. No apparent increased risk of cerebrovascular events occurs in patients who have had an episode of TGA. There is conflicting evidence as to whether an episode of TGA predisposes to future seizures or dementia."

    "Abstract": "Diabetic peripheral neuropathy occurs in up to 50% of patients with diabetes mellitus and increases the risk of diabetic foot ulcers and infections. Consistent screening and clear communication are essential to decrease disparities in assessment of neuropathic symptoms and diagnosis. Physicians should address underlying risk factors such as poor glycemic control, vitamin B12 deficiency, elevated blood pressure, and obesity to reduce the likelihood of developing neuropathy. First-line drug therapy for painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy includes duloxetine, gabapentin, amitriptyline, and pregabalin; however, these medications do not restore sensation to affected extremities. Evidence for long-term benefit and safety of first-line treatment options is lacking. Second-line drug therapy includes nortriptyline, imipramine, venlafaxine, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, topical lidocaine, and topical capsaicin. Periodic, objective monitoring of medication response is critical because patients may not obtain desired pain reduction, adverse effects are common, and serious adverse effects can occur. Opioids should generally be avoided. Nondrug therapies with low- to moderate-quality evidence include exercise and neuromodulation with spinal cord stimulation or transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation. Peripheral transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation is well tolerated and inexpensive, but benefits are modest. Other treatments, such as acupuncture, alpha-lipoic acid, acetyl-L-carnitine, cannabidiol, and onabotulinumtoxinA need further study in patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy."

    "Abstract": "Pediatric stroke is a condition that often results in life-long motor, cognitive, or sensory deficits for children. The purpose of this focused review is to compile the most recent literature on pediatric stroke neuromotor interventions and summarize evidence for use by rehabilitation providers and researchers. Terms including stroke, pediatric, and neuromotor were searched with appropriate MeSH terms. Information was collected regarding interventions conducted and outcome measures used for each article. Interventions and outcome measures were organized based on ICF components (Body Structure and Function, Activity, Participation, and Environmental Factors). 16 articles were included after full-text screens. From these 16 articles, a large majority of them included some form of neuromodulation as a part of intervention. Results identified a potentially problematic gap between domains addressed by interventions and measured by outcomes, with a need to include more expansive outcome measures in research studies. There are several areas of potential growth in pediatric stroke literature. Research studies should be precise when describing included samples. As interventions for pediatric stroke shift toward neuromodulation and other neurologic treatments, there is a need for well-defined populations, both clinically in the community as well as in research studies. There is also a need for US guidelines for rehabilitation after pediatric stroke. Overall, the trend in the literature seems to suggest that combining some form of neuromodulatory technique with existing recommended rehabilitation technique (ex: CIMT) may promote overall recovery for children after stroke, though further research is needed."

The nature and magnitude of microglial response to injury relates in part to peripheral immune cell invasion, extent of tissue damage, and the local microenvironment."

    "Abstract": "Prevalence of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the leading cause of blindness in the United States, increases greatly with age. While age is the greatest risk factor of AMD, other risks such as smoking, family history, complement pathway activation, and race exist. Various systemic inflammatory diseases share many of these risk factors with AMD, as well as a similar inflammatory profile. Due to these similarities, patient database studies analyzing the association between patients with various systemic diseases and AMD have been performed. In this review we will summarize recent finding on this subject and discuss the implications on AMD diagnosis. By gaining greater insight into the association between chronic systemic inflammation and AMD, implications for novel therapeutic approaches to treat AMD pathology may be identified."

    "Abstract": "<br><b>PURPOSE OF REVIEW:</b> Cognitive impairment is associated with negative effects on solid organ transplant candidates, recipients, and their care partners. However, because of the heterogeneity of mechanisms, presentations, and assessment measures, research suggests a wide array of impairments, patterns of impairments, and unclear trajectories posttransplant. This review provides an abbreviated synthesis of recent research on cognitive impairments observed in organ-eligible candidates and potential trajectories through posttransplant, current clinical recommendations regarding integration of assessment into routine clinical transplant practice, as well as recommendations for future research.<br><b>RECENT FINDINGS:</b> Transplantation may resolve certain disease-contributing factors to cognitive impairments but also introduces new potential neurocognitive assaults. Recent studies in kidney and lung recipients document continued impairments in subsets of patients, particularly those identified as frail. For liver candidates, new assessment measures of hepatic encephalopathy have been developed and preliminarily tested with potential for translation into routine clinical care. Clinical implications, as well as ethical considerations are discussed.<br><b>SUMMARY:</b> Although guidelines agree that cognitive assessment is an important part of the organ transplantation process, many questions remain of how to best assess cognition and intervene when cognitive impairment is identified in transplant populations. Further research should focus on prospective, longitudinal assessments in transplant-eligible populations through posttransplant."

    "Abstract": "<br><b>INTRODUCTION:</b> Addressing gaps in access to prenatal care is an important step to reversing rising rates of maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality and invites the exploration of innovative care models. This integrative review of published literature explores the patient, health care provider, and organizational experience of integrating virtual visits in prenatal care.<br><b>METHODS:</b> A literature search to identify original studies and quality improvement projects published between 2010 and 2020 was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, and Google Scholar using keywords associated with both telemedicine and prenatal care. Inclusion criteria specified articles pertaining to synchronous virtual visits between pregnant patients and health care providers, and articles were excluded if visits were not pregnancy-centric or pertaining to telemonitoring or mobile applications. Reference lists of identified reviews were screened, and a hand search of 4 applicable journals was also conducted. Findings were organized according to the factors of the social ecological model: individual, interpersonal, organizational, community, and public policy.<br><b>RESULTS:</b> The search identified 2666 articles after duplicates were removed, of which 13 met all criteria. Findings across these 13 articles indicated strong patient and health care provider satisfaction with virtual care related to cost savings and convenience, with clinic wait times and cancellation rates also improving. Health care provider input and thoughtful organizational planning were key to a smooth telemedicine implementation process. There were notably no significant differences in clinical outcomes for those who used virtual care.<br><b>DISCUSSION:</b> Although data are limited, offering an integrated model that uses both virtual visits and in-person visits has been well-received by patients and health care providers and could improve access to care well into the future. Virtual visits in prenatal care have been well-received by patients and health care providers, showing promise as an emerging model for improving access to care."

    "Abstract": "Empathy is a complex phenomenon critical for group survival and societal bonds. In addition, there is mounting evidence demonstrating empathic behaviors are dysregulated in a multitude of psychiatric disorders ranging from autism spectrum disorder, substance use disorders, and personality disorders. Therefore, understanding the underlying drive and neurobiology of empathy is paramount for improving the treatment outcomes and quality of life for individuals suffering from these psychiatric disorders. While there is a growing list of human studies, there is still much about empathy to understand, likely due to both its complexity and the inherent limitations of imaging modalities. It is therefore imperative to develop, validate, and utilize rodent models of empathic behaviors as translational tools to explore this complex topic in ways human research cannot. This review outlines some of the more prevailing theories of empathy, lists some of the psychiatric disorders with disrupted empathic processes, describes rat and mouse models of empathic behaviors currently used, and discusses ways in which these models have elucidated social, environmental, and neurobiological factors that may modulate empathy. The research tools afforded to rodent models will provide an increasingly clear translational understanding of empathic processes and consequently result in improvements in care for those diagnosed with any one of the many psychiatric disorders."

    "Abstract": "<br><b>PURPOSE OF REVIEW:</b> This manuscript describes the recommended therapy of chronic spontaneous urticaria based on our understanding of the pathogenesis of hive formation. Thus, the mechanism of action of each medication is elaborated in addition to a discussion of clinical utility.<br><b>RECENT FINDINGS:</b> The main drugs are antihistamines, omalizumab, and cyclosporine with a success rate of 40-55, 65-80, and 70-80%, respectively. Used in sequence, over 90% of patients can be successfully treated. The addition of omalizumab represents a major advance because of its efficacy, easy utility, and favorable side-effect profile. The interaction with IgE eliminates any reaction with antigens to which it might be directed, down regulates IgE receptors on mast cells and basophils, and leads to down-regulation of mast cell functions with amelioration of hives.<br><b>SUMMARY:</b> The use of antihistamines in high dosage (at least four times a day) is effective in close to half the patients with CSU. For antihistamine resistance, the use of omalizumab has revolutionized therapy of antihistamine-resistant cases because of its efficacy and excellent side-effect profile. If the response is insufficient, cyclosporine is the next choice. Patients should be monitored regarding any adverse effects on blood pressure or renal function. All these are far safer than extended use of corticosteroid."

    "Abstract": "Workplace-based clinical supervision is common in community based mental health care for youth and families and could be a leveraged to scale and improve the implementation of evidence-based treatment (EBTs). Accurate methods are needed to measure, monitor, and support supervisor performance with limited disruption to workflow. Audit and Feedback (A&F) interventions may offer some promise in this regard. The study-a randomized controlled trial with 60 clinical supervisors measured longitudinally for 7 months-had two parts: (1) psychometric evaluation of an observational coding system for measuring adherence and competence of EBT supervision and (2) evaluation of an experimental Supervisor Audit and Feedback (SAF) intervention on outcomes of supervisor adherence and competence. All supervisors recorded and uploaded weekly supervision sessions for 7 months, and those in the experimental condition were provided a single, monthly web-based feedback report. Psychometric performance was evaluated using measurement models based in Item Response Theory, and the effect of the SAF intervention was evaluated using mixed-effects regression models. The observational instrument performed well across psychometric indicators of dimensionality, rating scale functionality, and item fit; however, coder reliability was lower for competence than for adherence. Statistically significant A&F effects were largely in the expected directions and consistent with hypotheses. The observational coding system performed well, and a monthly electronic feedback report showed promise in maintaining or improving community-based clinical supervisors' adherence and, to a lesser extent, competence. Limitations discussed include unknown generalizability to the supervision of other EBTs."

    "Abstract": "Sexual assault is a major public health concern associated with significant mental health and medical symptoms. Follow-up screening post-sexual assault medical forensic examination (SAMFE) can be one method of determining needs and providing targeted prevention of mental health and medical symptoms among individuals who experienced a recent sexual assault. However, the factors associated with engagement in post-SAMFE follow-up screening have not been identified. The current study examined the association between intimate partner violence victimization and sexual assault-related characteristics and engagement in post-SAMFE follow-up screening. Participants were 193 individuals who received a SAMFE and indicated at the time of SAMFE that they were interested in follow-up by the hospital. It was found that individuals were less likely to engage in follow-up screening if the assault was perpetrated by an intimate partner. These findings suggest that other resources are needed to reach individuals who experience sexual assault perpetrated by an intimate partner due to the unique needs of that population."

    "Abstract": "Seizure freedom is recognized as the goal of epilepsy treatment by patients, families, and in treatment guidelines and is associated with notably improved quality of life. However, many studies of epilepsy treatments (including antiseizure medications/antiepileptic drugs, neurostimulation, and dietary therapies) fail to report data on seizure freedom. Even among studies that include this outcome, methods for defining and analyzing seizure freedom vary considerably. Thus, the available data are often difficult to interpret and comparisons between studies are particularly challenging. Although these issues had been identified over a decade ago, there remains a lack of clarity and standardized methods used in analyzing and reporting seizure freedom outcomes in studies of epilepsy treatments. In addition, it remains unclear whether short-term seizure freedom outcomes from pivotal clinical trials are predictive of longer-term seizure freedom outcomes for patients with treatment-refractory epilepsy. Ultimately, the limitations of the available data lead to the potential for misinterpretation and misunderstanding of seizure freedom outcomes associated with the spectrum of available treatments when examining treatment options for patients. Clearly defined outcome analyses of seizure freedom attainment and duration are essential in future clinical studies of treatment for seizures to guide treatment selection and modification for patients."

    "Abstract": "Introduction: Telehealth is a rapidly expanding health care delivery modality with increasing utility in the health care community. It is imperative that telehealth education is provided during the training of health care providers to ensure the proper usage and application of this health care delivery system. A comprehensive literature review of telehealth education integrated into the curricula of physician, physician assistant, and advanced practiced registered nurse training programs has not been reported to date. Materials and Methods: An electronic literature search was performed using Scopus®, PubMed, and 17 of the 35 databases on the EBSCOHost platform. We included studies where telehealth concepts and components were integrated in the curriculum for primary care students. We extracted information pertinent to understanding the scope and sustainability of the curriculum and tabulated the results. Results: After a full-text screening of 164 articles and critically analyzing 34, eight articles were included in this review. Comparison of these articles showed no consistency in how telehealth was integrated into the various health care curricula. Content delivered usually included basic telehealth information, however, the depth and breadth of content varied significantly based on the interventions. Discussion: For the articles included in this review, there were no formal study designs regarding basic telehealth educational integration or competencies. While authors recommended conducting evaluation and determining the effectiveness of the interventions, they did not provide a clear picture as to how these efforts should be conducted. Conclusions: In addition to developing a standardized telehealth curriculum, national competencies need to be created, which will guide the development of standardized curriculum across health care training programs."
